Strategy of Preeminence and building alliances

Philosophical strategy that can be a driving force behind how you relate to people in business and life

Strategy of Preeminence - asks you to suspend the way you have operated business and relate to customers and people

Asks you to see yourself as your most trusted advisor/counsel/confidant in the field of endeavor in the area of expertise and in the outcome area that your product or service produces in their life

You want to be seen as the definitive expert source and most trusted source and fiduciary of your area of expertise

You have to start a lot of shifts:
Attitude of who you are selling to


Competition wants to marginalize our advantage
And customer


You should never let the customer purchase something with less quality, quantity and frequency than they absolutely should. That breaches your contract with them as their fiduciary


Start by changing focus of what you do and who you do it for.

Don’t fall in love with your company, product, or service. Fall in love with your client. You’re business is designed to make other lives improved

Don’t use customer -> use the word client. It connotes a much higher level of relationship. Authoritative respect.

As a fiduciary, that’s what they do
Customer - someone who purchases a commodity or service
Client - someone who is under the care and protection of another

3 clients
	Team members and staff
	Vendors
	people who buy your product

Marketing, Strategy, and
Innovation - orchestrating change to better a clients situation

Never allow someone to do whatever they want.

Example of half glass of water.
Moral obligation to tell the customer a half glass of water isn’t enough. You are obligated, as the expert, to let the customer know they need 8 glasses of water - at your business or elsewhere

Never let anyone buy less quality, less quantity, the wrong combination.

“I can’t sell you that, it won’t serve you well”

Your relationship is a permanent one, not static. If you have nothing else to sell to them, they are still important to you and you need to concern yourself with them.

The SoP presumes that you are not going to wait for money to change hands before you start guiding, counseling, and helping people you deal with.
Deal with people as if they are already your client

Dispel forever  -> “Am I worthy of the goal I’ve set?”
			-> “Is the goal worthy of me?”

Live to make peoples life better because you’re in it.

You will learn to listen to what people are saying. Their point is more important than your point.

If you want to be the most interesting person in the world, be the most interested.

How much more value can you give to your client that they appreciate and desire. Establish yourself as the solution to the problem your client has - giving them clarity about the problem they are experiencing and informing them exactly how to solve it.

Examine, understand, respect, appreciate, and carefully evaluate how others see life. You don’t need to agree with them but you need to understand them and their life. Empathize.

Others relate in different modalities - figure it out and engage with them on their level.


19/ So you end up with a mess of organizing constructs: hierarchies, networks, group boundaries, permission levels, version histories, event histories, and so on.
20/ If you tried to extend a platonic concept like "hierarchy" or "network" you'd end up with impossibly high-dimensional structures that are empty for the most part.
21/ Instead, you switch to only modeling things that have information content, and doing so piecemeal. You end up with "crumpled" versions of high-dimensional structures in low-dimensional spaces.
22/ In my rhizome picture above for example, there are a dozen dimensions (the words in green). But I have a loose, gingery representation in 3d space.
23/ Things are related as they are pragmatically required to be, and interpenetrate and relatively orient as is most convenient, rather than to conform to a platonic pattern.
24/ The archetypal action in a rhizomatic information architecture is cut-and-paste. The spreadsheet is the archetypal integration tool: a sort of generalized clipboard.
25/ There is a relationship here to the idea that the medium is the message, and Conway's law (product structure mirrors org structure).
26/ Our information environments are becoming rhizomatic because our informational lives are becoming rhizomatic, and vice versa, in a chicken-and-egg loop.
27/ Tools with rhizomatic dispositions include, besides cut-and-paste and spreadsheets, things like IFTTT, Zapier, and at the enterprise level, things like microservices.
28/ Rhizomes aren't just about information. They are also about computational capabilities, distribution capabilities, relationships, trust, and permission architectures.
29/ Two of the biggest technologies evolving today -- the blockchain and machine learning -- are fundamentally rhizomatic in their DNA. You have to tread gingerly around them.
30/ Both have the predisposition to follow the contours of information content rather than idealized organization patterns. Neither is architecturally well-behaved and disciplined.
31/ Rhizomes are information dense, topologically complex (things connecting in weird ways), highly heterogeneous and variegated, structurally compact, and with strong form-content coupling.
32/ Unlike pure-paradigm architectures, rhizomes mix and match multiple architectural paradigms along with emergent structures to create high-dissonance information environments.
33/ What is it like to live in a rhizome? Well for starters, there are no default entry or exit points, no "onboarding manual" that teaches you how to survive in one, and no "up."
34/ There is perhaps a distinction between a n00b and an expert, but it is highly localized around specific corners of the rhizome. You can go from n00b to expert and back to n00b in 2 steps.
35/ In a traditional org, you can count the floors between the executive suite and say the shop floor where blue-collar workers build products on assembly lines. Authority falls as the elevator descends.
36/ n00b/expert relationships change slowly and predictably in space as you move. Expertise and authority turfs are simply connected and simply bounded.
37/ In a rhizome, in a move from point A to point B, relative knowledge and expertise might swing wildly. And the value of actions might swing wildly while you're moving.
38/ A rhizome is also a high-friction space. Movement through a rhizome involves an unpredictable stream of transaction costs. Every journey is an obstacle course.
39/ Sometimes there's a good FAQ page, other times a tweet makes a difference between a minute and a week. Discovered structure, rather than inferences from maps, dictates the cost of action.
40/ Sometimes having a programmer friend whom you can quickly email can make the impossible possible. Sometimes an online forum saves hours, sometimes it wastes hours.
41/ Sometimes a single click moves mountains. Other times, you need to move mountains to do one tiny thing. Effort-outcome relationships get out of whack.
42/ Sometimes really important things are trivially easy if you happen to know somebody who knows one weird trick. Other times, common-sense things turn out to be impossible.
43/ In a rhizomatic world, if your expectations and work habits are built around architectural cleanliness, you will get deeply frustrated and be perennially frozen.
44/ If you can only navigate well-paved paths and clean, well-lit spaces, you'll likely spend a lot of time in low-value, or even futile, ritualized behaviors while getting nothing done.
45/ You must be willing to adopt an opportunistic approach to navigating complexity, and switch from ugly hack to elegant beauty, from amateurish fumble to expert flourish, in an instant.
46/ You've heard of analysis paralysis, right? I have a similar concept I call aesthetic paralysis: the desire for elegance in behavior limiting your agency. Superficial beauty is expensive in a rhizome.
47/ This is not to say rhizomes are ugly. Once you accept their inevitability, the act of navigating a rhizome can start to acquire its own beauty.
48/ You start to be less attached to received ideas of importance, order, and logic, and learn to interact with the natural logic of the environment.
49/ You learn to adjust your aesthetic sensibilities to what you're experiencing, so you can actually see what's going on, rather than being bound by aesthetic expectations.
50/ You start to gain what a friend of mine just described as "infrastructure fluency." This is in a way the opposite of architectural taste: an ability to experience the artificial world in its natural language.
51/ Unlike in physical architecture, where there is such thing as an architect's view of reality, the only guide to a true rhizome is a burglar's guide. So stop worrying, and learn to love your frankenstack.
