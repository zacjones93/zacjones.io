# Strategy of Preeminence

This post is a collection of my thoughts and notes on Jay Abraham's talk on [Advanced Strategy of Preeminence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gw14EJkzYs) which addresses Jay's #1 strategy for approaching business and life in general.

## Definition of Preeminence

What does 'preeminence' even mean? I looked it up and google tells me:

> the fact of surpassing all others; superiority

So, cool. Preeminence is a strategy for surpassing all others in business and life.

Simple enough, so what do you do?

The answer, to me, is surprising at first but Jay's strategy is that Preeminence "extols, advocates, and champions the role of the team member, supplier, prospect or customer."

Itâ€™s all about bringing people the clarity they need to solve the problems they have to make their life better for themselves and those around them.

That's interesting, there's not much talk of ME in that definition. But that's the thing, it's not about me, it's about how I can relate to others and what I can do for them.

By doing that, you'll set yourself up for success. People want to come back to, promote and and purchase products or services from someone who they know has their best interest in mind and has shown themselves to be a trusted advisor.

## How to start

You want others to see yourself as the most trusted advisor, counsel, confidant, and fiduciary in the field of endeavor in the area of expertise and in the outcome area that your product or service produces in you're clients life.
