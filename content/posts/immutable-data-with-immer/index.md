Using immutable data to store state has many interesting benefits. Immutable data makes it easy to trace state over time. It can be distributed easily, and by leveraging structural sharing we can leverage optimization techniques such as memoization.

In this course we will build a multi user gift-list, in which we will discover how using immer doesn’t just significantly simplifies our state manipulation code. It also provides us with very useful tools such as patches that can help us to distribute changes, build undo/ redo, etc.

I took some notes on this topic from Michel Weststrates [Immutable JavaScript Data Structures with Immer](https://egghead.io/courses/immutable-javascript-data-structures-with-immer) egghead io course.
